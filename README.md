## Background and Motivation:

As AlphaGo defeated the world's best Go player in 2016, AI is brought into the classroom to individualize learning in the form of adaptive learning. It analyzes the students and note their weaknesses and strengths, then changes the course around so that students can polish up areas which they may be struggling with. It also responds to the students' needs and personalize the course to best fit their talents. We take this chance to discuss the most recent development of machine learning technology used in education and to provide a forum for communication of researchers active in machine learning used in education. 

## Topics:

Interested topics include, but are not limited to:

  
  1) Personalized learning paths: Students learn knowledge points at their individual speeds. Machine learning can help incorporate adaptive learning in classrooms through algorithms that let the students move ahead based on their speed of mastering knowledge points. Teachers can thus assess the understanding of an individual student or a class as a whole. This insight allows teachers to adjust their pace and delivery according to student progress, and be able to help each student individually, if required.
  
  2) Content Analytics: Content analytics refers to machine learning platforms that optimize modules for students and teachers. Through machine learning, content taught to students can be analyzed for maximum effect and optimized to take care of student needs. It enables educators and content providers to not just create and manage their e-Learning content, but also gain important insights into learner progress and understanding through a powerful set of analytics.
  
  3) Scoring: Machine learning also helps teachers in scoring assessments in less time and with greater accuracy. Current scoring systems primarily rely on humans, but with machine learning assessments can be scored in an automated manner. As an example, software that detects plagiarism in essays is already used by educators worldwide.
  
  4) Automating repetitive tasks: Teachers in traditional classroom setups spend a lot of time on repetitive tasks such as attendance, collecting assignments, etc. With technology, these tasks can be automated, allowing teachers more bandwidth to spend time with students tackling modules, concepts, and discussing higher-order thinking.
  
  5) Learning analytics: Machine learning also has a pivotal role to play in tracking student learning and progress. Learning analytics is more than just providing data to teachers. Machine learning algorithms create value for the system through designing predictive learning paths for students. As students progress through a course with adaptive learning software, machine learning algorithms decide if reinforcement is required through additional content or if they have adequately mastered concepts and can move ahead. Learning analytics, thus, focuses on tracking student knowledge and enhancing their learning environment.
