## Background and Motivation:

As AlphaGo defeated the world's best Go player in 2016, AI is brought into the classroom to individualize learning in the form of adaptive learning. It analyzes the students and note their weaknesses and strengths, then changes the course around so that students can polish up areas which they may be struggling with. It also responds to the students' needs and personalize the course to best fit their talents. We take this chance to discuss the most recent development of machine learning technology used in education and to provide a forum for communication of researchers active in machine learning used in education. 

## Topics:

Interested topics include, but are not limited to:

  
  1) Personalized learning paths: Students learn knowledge points at their individual speeds. Machine learning can help incorporate adaptive learning in classrooms through algorithms that let the students move ahead based on their speed of mastering knowledge points. Teachers can thus assess the understanding of an individual student or a class as a whole. This insight allows teachers to adjust their pace and delivery according to student progress, and be able to help each student individually, if required.
  
  2) Content Analytics: Content analytics refers to machine learning platforms that optimize modules for students and teachers. Through machine learning, content taught to students can be analyzed for maximum effect and optimized to take care of student needs. It enables educators and content providers to not just create and manage their e-Learning content, but also gain important insights into learner progress and understanding through a powerful set of analytics.
  
  3) Scoring: Machine learning also helps teachers in scoring assessments in less time and with greater accuracy. Current scoring systems primarily rely on humans, but with machine learning assessments can be scored in an automated manner. As an example, software that detects plagiarism in essays is already used by educators worldwide.
  
  4) Automating repetitive tasks: Teachers in traditional classroom setups spend a lot of time on repetitive tasks such as attendance, collecting assignments, etc. With technology, these tasks can be automated, allowing teachers more bandwidth to spend time with students tackling modules, concepts, and discussing higher-order thinking.
  
  5) Learning analytics: Machine learning also has a pivotal role to play in tracking student learning and progress. Learning analytics is more than just providing data to teachers. Machine learning algorithms create value for the system through designing predictive learning paths for students. As students progress through a course with adaptive learning software, machine learning algorithms decide if reinforcement is required through additional content or if they have adequately mastered concepts and can move ahead. Learning analytics, thus, focuses on tracking student knowledge and enhancing their learning environment.

08:40 - 09:30 Identifying Personality by Content Analysis  

by Dr. Tingshao Zhu, professor enlisted in hundred talents program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 

Biography:
Tingshao Zhu, earned his first Ph.D at the institute of computing technolgoy Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1999, and second Ph.D at the University of Alberta Canada in 2006. From 2008, he started working as a Professor at the Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS) in Beijing, and then moved to the Institute of Psychology CAS, to focus on cyber psychology. 
Dr. Zhu has extensive experience on Data Mining and Machine Learning. His recent work on cyber psychology, that is, to predict personality, mental health, social well-being, etc. of web users based on web behavior. The results on microblog (Sina Weibo) demonstrate that it is applicable to predict psychological features on web behavior. 
He has published over 60 papers in major international academic conferences and journals. The main foci of his current work are (1) web user behavior modeling; (2)Computational CyberPsychologyand (3) data mining.

Abstract:
Because of its richness and availability, social media has become an ideal platform for conducting psychological research. We proposed to predict active users' personality traits through micro-blogging behaviors. 547 Chinese active users of micro-blogging participated in this study. Their personality traits were measured by the Big Five Inventory, and digital records of micro-blogging behaviors were collected via web crawlers. After extracting 845 micro-blogging behavioral features, we first trained classification models utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM), differentiating participants with high and low scores on each dimension of the Big Five Inventory. The classification accuracy ranged from 84% to 92%. We also built regression models utilizing PaceRegression methods, predicting participants’ scores on each dimension of the Big Five Inventory. The Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted scores and actual scores ranged from 0.48 to 0.54. By using the predicting model, we can conduct some noval research to investigate the personality of individuals in humanities.

09:30 - 10:10 Increasing Our Knowledge: Introducing A New Multi-Dimensional Model for Knowledge Assessment and Learning   

by Dr. Dan Bindman, chief data scientist at Yixue Education

Biography:
Dan Bindman holds the Ph.D. Degree in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences from UCI and the B.S. Degree in Math-Applied Sciences from UCLA. He served ALEKS Corporation from 2002 to 2018.
ALEKS Corporation is a leader in the creation of Web-based, artificially intelligent, educational software. Bindman was the Editorial Director and one of the principal architects of ALEKS, playing a lead role in product, algorithm and AI design, and leading diverse teams in “end to end” implementation of these designs for all the ALEKS math products, and other key features and systems, including two instructor modules.
In 2015, Dan developed a new powerful model of student knowledge. In 2018, He joined Yixue Education, and is currently working with Yixue Education to implement the model. 

Abstract:
What are the key components for a strong adaptive learning system? (1) Very strong content. This means the questions and lessons must cover everything that needs to be covered in the course, with great quality questions, explanations, and lessons. (2) An automated system (AI) that uses each student’s recent history in the course to precisely map the student’s current knowledge at a very high resolution—determining exactly which questions, lessons, or topics the student has fully mastered, not mastered, or partially mastered. (3) An automated system (AI) that uses this high resolution map of the student’s knowledge, to custom choose learning material that is ideal for that particular student to learn—neither too easy nor too hard, but at just the right level of difficulty given the student’s current knowledge. 
In this talk, we will focus on a new model that can help with (2) and (3). We measure student knowledge with the Probabilistic Knowledge State (PKS). It is assumed that a student’s PKS accurately and completely reflects the underlying knowledge of the student. That is, the PKS gives the actual probabilities correct for the student at any given time t; they would not be closer to 0 or 1 even if we were “all knowing” and knew everything about the student. So in this model, students can have “partial knowledge” or “partial mastery” of a given question such that the probability correct for this question is substantially higher than the probability of a lucky guess, but still far from the maximum probability correct that the students could attain if they had completely mastered the question. This is a very important aspect of the model.

Abstract:
Educational machine learning (EML) is a promising tool for personalized teaching and learning. Different from traditional educational studies, EML aims to learning the educational patterns from data. EML is a young field and has a lot of challenging problems. In this talk, I mainly introduce the work progress of EML group in NWPU, including cognitive diagnose, next-term grade prediction, and student early warning. To probe the status of knowledge mastery, we propose the robust cognitive diagnose method from 1-bit data by learning a knowledge dictionary with a sparse guess-and-error matrix. And we integrate two graphs created by side information into robust matrix factorization to carry out the next-term grade prediction. Finally, we extract the features from multi-sources multi-mode data and then classify the students for early warning, using the deep learning model. In addition, we show the conclusions and discussions on the educational data set of NWPU.
